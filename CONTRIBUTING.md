# Commits & Pull Requests

- If you're making a big contribution/adding a new feature, raise an issue for it first.
- When making a change to the UI, provide a screenshot or video as well.

## Strict

Make sure all your scripts are `--!strict` unless you have a good reason not to. You may see that a lot of the codebase is not `--!strict` at the moment. Do not follow my lead. 😔
